Password Generator (Homework) Brian Sales

This program uses the Math.random and Math.floor functions and Javascript to generate a new password. The user can select what characters (numbers and/or letters and/or special characters) he wants to have in the password, and the total number of characters in the password. After the user selects the length of the desired password, and the type of characters he wants in the password, an array is constructed containing all of the available characters based on the users input. The Math.floor and Math.random functions are then used to select the first character in the password. A “for loop” is used to generate the remaining characters in the password, and the result is output to the screen using the given Javascript code. 

I would like to thank my tutor, Eric Sayer, for helping with some of the code.
